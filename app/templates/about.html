            <p>My name is Bryan Bugyi and I am a student of Computer Science.&nbsp; I have been enthusiastic about computers for as long as I can remember and consider myself extraordinarily fortunate to have the opportunity to make a career out of something that I love.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>I am 25 years old and I live with my girlfriend Kelly.&nbsp; She is my rock.&nbsp; When I'm not studying or working on a project, my favorite things to do are to spend time with her and our Olde English Bulldog, Rocky.&nbsp;

            <!-- <p>When not with the family, you might find me at the beach surfing.&nbsp; I have been surfing for 6 years now and have fallen in love with the sport.&nbsp; There are few places I'd rather be than 50 yards out waiting for the next set to roll in.&nbsp; </p> -->

            <p>If there is just one thing that you should know about me, it is that I am passionate.&nbsp; And I consider it my responsibility to be so.&nbsp;</p>
